## Hypotheses and Results

When testing the hypothesis that new customers churn more, the dataset shows that a total of 378 new customers have churned.  
Its effect on the model (Logistic Regression) is -1.383536, meaning the longer the tenure, the lower the likelihood of leaving; a 2‑year contract helps retain customers, while a monthly contract increases the likelihood of churn.

For the hypothesis that women churn less — the model shows that this feature has a very small effect and almost does not influence decision‑making.

Regarding the hypothesis that internet service users churn more — its impact on the model is negative (-0.216336), which means customers without internet service are less likely to churn frequently.
